# No External Access, Air-gap Systems

For some types of HPC workloads in areas such as national security, government, defense, pharmaceutical and commercially sensitive & highly regulated industries such as finance, medical, require additional levels of security. That often requires the HPC cluster to be air-gapped, which means that the cluster is isolated from any external networks. However, how these clusters are configured is highly dependent upon the policies for that particular cluster and the potential threat level. These types of secure systems often have specialized setups and not much is known about them and are not discussed in public.

In addition, transferring data to and from these system can be extremely slow due to the security measures and taking more than an month to get data on or off the cluster is not unheard of.
