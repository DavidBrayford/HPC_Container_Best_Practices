# Full External Access Systems

System with full external access typically enable incoming and outgoing ssh connections and internet access via https, http, ftp from the login nodes and sometimes the compute nodes. However, it is very rare that a HPC cluster is configured to enable the compute nodes to access the internet and would typically indicate a misconfigured system.

These systems are relatively easy to use from the end-user perspective, as the end-user can easily access remote servers to transfer data. Nevertheless, these types of systems are rarely deployed due to the conscious and unconscious misuse by internal and external actors.
