# Singularity & Apptainer

Singularity & Apptainer are the most widely used containerization technologies employed in HPC.

Singularity [] was developed at LBL to be a containerization solution for HPC systems and supports several HPC components such as resource managers, job schedulers and contains built in MPI features. Singularity uses the layered OCI container image and snapshot it into a SIF file.

Apptainer [] was developed by CIQ and at the time of writing this paper can be considered to be the open source version of Singularity. However, in the future Singularity and Apptainer might diverge significantly.
